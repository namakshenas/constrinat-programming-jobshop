# constrinat-programming-jobshop
A constraint programming implementation of Job Shop scheduling problem to minimize total tardiness (Ilog CP optimizer + Java)

 - You need to install `ILOG CPLEX` that provides an API for `Java` applications that use CPLEX. This allows your Java application to call CPLEX directly, through the JNI (Java Native Interface). The Java interface is built on top of ILOG Concert Technology for Java and supplies a rich functionality allowing you to use Java objects to build your optimization model.

- CPLEX provides classes that implement Concert Technology interfaces, and are optimized for use with CPLEX.
